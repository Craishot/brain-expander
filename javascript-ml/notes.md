# Machine Learning With Javascript

## Section 1: What is Machine Learning

### The Rainfall Problem
* We want to predict the amount of flood damage that occurs based on a given amount of rainfall
* In this case we care about two pieces of data, the amount of rainfall on any given year and the amount of flood damage that occurs on any given year
  * With this, the amount of rainfall for each year comprises our `features` and the amount of flood damage comprises our `labels`
* Because we are predicting an outcome from a continuous set, we want to make use of a `regression` algorithm to determine a correlation between our features and labels
  * Based on our chosen algorithm, the hope is that the program discovers a relationship between our features and labels

### A Machine Learning Problem Solving Process
1. Identify the data that is relevant to the problem
  * Independent variables are also knows as `features`
  * Dependent variables are also known as `labels`
2. Assemble a set of data related ot the problem you are trying to solve
  * Data will not always be handed to you on a silver platter; groundwork research may need to be done
3. Decide on the type of output you are predicting
  * There are two common types of data that we may try to predict:
    1. **Classification**: The value of our labels belong to a discrete set
      * This means we are predicting a value from a discrete (limited) set
    2. **Regression**: The value of our labels belong to a continuous set
      * This means we are predicting a value from a large range of values, i.e. the outcome of the prediction could be any value from a continuous set
4. Based on the type of output, pick an algorithm that will determine a correlation between your features and labels
5. Use model generated by algorithm to make a prediction

### Important Takeaways From the Problem Solving Process Above
* **Features** are categories of data points that affect the value of a **label**
* Datasets almost always require cleanup or formatting
* **Regression** used with continuous values, **classification** used with discrete values
* Many, many different algorithms exist, each with pros and cons
* Models relate the value of **features** to the value of **labels**

### The Plinko Problem
* **Goal**: Given some data about where a ball is dropped from, can we predict what bucket it will end up in?
* Relevant Data:
  * Drop position (in pixels) -> `feature`
  * The bucket the ball lands in -> `label`
  * The bounciness of the ball -> `feature`
  * The size of the ball -> `feature`
* Based on our determined relevant data, we have three features and one label, where the drop position, ball bounciness, and ball size affect the bucket the ball will land in.
* In Javascript where are two distinct ways in which we can record datasets:
  1. Array of objects
  2. Array of arrays
    * The array of arrays approach is initially more confusing but once we're used to it, it's a lot easier to make use of
    * With this approach we have to keep track of the meaning of each index of the inner arrays
* Based on that there is a discrete set of buckets available for the balls to drop in, we are working with a regression problem, and thus need to make use of a regression algorithm
* Stephen picked the regression algorithm we're going to use for us, and so we're using the **K-Nearest Neighbor (knn)** algorithm (because it makes intuitive sense to us ML beginners)
